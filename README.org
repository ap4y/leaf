* Leaf

*Leaf* is a flashcard app that uses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][spaced repetition]]
 algorithm. *Leaf* focuses on simplifying database management, ease of
 access and support for various spaced repetition curves (including
 custom).

** Getting started

*Leaf* is a [[https://golang.org/][golang]] application and you are going to need golang
toolchain to compile the app.

To install or update run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
go get -u github.com/ap4y/leaf/cmd/leaf
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
go get -u github.com/ap4y/leaf/cmd/leaf-server
#+END_SRC

Leaf provides 2 different versions:

- ~leaf~ is a command line utility that provides review UI in the terminal
- ~leaf-server~ is a web app that implements review UI along with
  additional features like stats viewer.

Both utilities have following configuration options:

- ~-decks .~ is a path to a folder with deck files.
- ~-db leaf.db~ is a location of a stats DB that contains spaced
  repetition variables for your decks.
- ~-count 20~ is a maximum amount of cards per review.
- ~-algo sm2+c~ is a spaced repetition algorithm to use. All possible values can be found [[https://github.com/ap4y/leaf/blob/master/stats.go#L35-L44][here]].

For ~leaf-server~ you can also adjust address to start server on via ~-addr :8000~.

Terminal CLI (~leaf~) has following commands:

- ~review~ will initiate review for a deck
- ~stats~ will return stats snapshots for a deck

Both commands expect deck name after the command name. Full example:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./leaf -decks ./fixtures review Hiragana
#+END_SRC

** Database management

*Leaf* uses plain text files structured usin [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Headlines.html#Headlines][org-mode headlines]]. Consider following file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Sample
** Question 1
Answer 1
** Question 2
Answer 2
#+END_SRC

Such file will be parsed as a deck named _Sample_ and it will have 2
cards. For a full deck example check [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ap4y/leaf/master/fixtures/hiragana.org][hiragana]] deck.

You can use text formatting, images, links and code blocks in your deck
files. Check [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ap4y/leaf/master/fixtures/org-mode.org][org-mode]] deck for an overview of supported options.

Spaced repetition variables are stored in a separate file in a binary
database. You can edit deck files at any time and changes will be
automatically reflected in the web app.

** Spaced repetition algorithms

*Leaf* implements multiple spaced repetition algorithms and allows you
to define new ones. Following algorithms are supported as of now:

- [[https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2][supermemo2]]
- [[http://www.blueraja.com/blog/477/a-better-spaced-repetition-learning-algorithm-sm2][supermemo2+]]
- Custom curve for supermemo2+. I found it works better for me.
- [[https://fasiha.github.io/ebisu.js/][ebisu]]

You can find calculated intervals in corresponding test files. Check
[[https://github.com/ap4y/leaf/blob/master/stats.go#L9-19][SRSAlgorithm]] interface to define a new algorithm or curve.

Please keep in mind that algorithm variables may not be compatible
with each other and algorithm switching is not supported.

** Review rating

All reviews are rated using ~[0..1]~ scale. Rating higher than ~0.6~
will mark review as successful. You can use 2 different types of
rating systems:

- ~auto~ (default) is based on amount of mistakes made during review. For ~auto~
  rating is assigned using [[https://github.com/ap4y/leaf/blob/master/rating.go#L35-L37][HarshRater]] which implements steep curve and
  a single mistake will have score less than ~0.6~. Check [[https://github.com/ap4y/leaf/blob/master/rating.go#L24-L26][Rater]]
  interface to get understanding how to define a different rater
  curve.

- ~self~ is a self assessment system. You have to assign score for
  each review and score will be converted to a rating as such: ~hard =
  0.2~, ~good = 0.6~, ~easy = 1.0~, ~again~ will push card back into
  the review queue.

To change rating system for a deck define org-mode property ~RATER~
in your deck file, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Sample
:PROPERTIES:
:RATER: self
:END:
** Question 1
Answer 1
#+END_SRC
